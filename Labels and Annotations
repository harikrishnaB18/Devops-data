Lables are  key/value pairs that are attached to objects such as pods
lables cabn be used to organize and to select subsets of objects

"metadata": {
  "labels": {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2"
  }
}

eg:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: label-demo
  labels:
    environment: production
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

create a label
#kubectl create -f <label name>
To connect a pod
#kubectl exec -it <pod name>
check the pod with label name
#kubectl get pods -l <label name>  ie:(environment=production)
LABEL SELECTORS:
There are two types of label selectors:
Equality-based requirements  (Three kinds of operators are admitted =,==,!=)
set-based requirements   (Three kinds of operators are supported: in,notin and exists)

what are the commands to filter the lable names:
#kubectl get pods
#kubectl get pods --show-labels
#kubectl get pods -l environment=production
#kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (production)'
#kubectl get pods -l 'environment in '(production.development)'

Annotations, like labels, are key/value maps:
"metadata": {
  "annotations": {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2"
  }
}

eg:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: annotations-demo
  annotations:
    imageregistry: "https://hub.docker.com/"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
